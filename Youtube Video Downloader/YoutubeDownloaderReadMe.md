i'm not sure the legality of downloading youtube videos for free but anyways.
this essentially uses pytube, it's pretty straightforward, it takes the link, ensures it's good, and throws a high resolution video into a download folder that it makes! 

that's about all she wrote. has simple print lines just to update the user as it goes.

i did test it with a 10 hour 4K video and i got really impatient so i quit it and added a timer to show how long it takes, then tested it with a 1 hour 4k video and it took a whole 40 seconds! less than i thought.
