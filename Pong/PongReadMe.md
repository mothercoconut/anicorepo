this is my pong game! it's pretty simple but there's some 'quality of life' things I added that I thought would be nice, so they are:
the ball return angle depends on WHERE on the paddle the ball was hit. if the ball hits the top of the paddle, it returns with a more upward vector, bottom of paddle = downward vector.

ball speed multiplies as the round goes on so it doesn't last forever!

paddle speed is limited, mostly so the computer is actually beatable otherwise it's the Pong God.

scorecounter, obviously.

it's quite simple but it was nice to make.
